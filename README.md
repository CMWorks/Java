An archive (dump) of all of my dumb Java projects


<b>1: Graphing</b><br>
 <t>The Graphing program is what it seems, a program that graphs functions
  There are currently 3 modes in this version; Rectangular, Polar, Slope
  There is currently no way for user-inputed functions, the only way to cange functions in in code.
  More is discused int he ReadMe files
